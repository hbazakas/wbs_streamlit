Streamlit webapp to display Reddit scraping results

Results are scraped in real time when the app is loaded. Displays 10 most talked about tickers and tokens from wallstreetbets and satoshistreetbets.
This is a streamlined version of the project for hosting on streamlit. I've posted the code for my previous iteration of this webapp, hosted on Heroku, elsewhere on my Github.
